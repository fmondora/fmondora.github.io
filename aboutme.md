I'm one of the founders of mondora srl sb, with over 20 years experience in the IT world. I am a visionary and an optimist, and enjoy working on Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain and Robotics. As well as being the co-CEO of Benefit Corporation mondora, I'm also a passionate teacher, specialised in Executive Coaching and an expert of Corporate Agile Management and Business Strategy.  

I am a disruptive thinker who loves collaborating with people and businesses in building and adapting self organised companies and focusing on the happiness of employees.  
I can often be found speaking about these topics at conferences and events throughout Europe.
