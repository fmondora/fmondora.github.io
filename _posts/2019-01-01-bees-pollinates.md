# Bees

![The presentation](/assets/bees.png)

Bees steal
Yes, bees steal
Yes, bees steal honey
Just like most of the companies who do business
The difference is that bees, as they steal honey, also collect pollen and carry it around
Bees pollinate
Bees create benefit for the community
Bees take, but they create benefit and wellbeing
The new companies also take and create benefit and wellbeing
No, bees don’t steal
Bees only create benefit, making profit
Let’s try to be inspired by nature
