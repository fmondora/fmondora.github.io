# Bees  


![Bees](/assets/bees.png){: .image-left .fifty}Bees steal  
Yes, bees steal  
Yes, bees steal honey  
Just like most of the companies who do business  
The difference is that bees, as they steal honey, also collect pollen and carry it around  
**Bees pollinate**  
Bees create benefit for the community  
Bees take, but they create benefit and wellbeing  
The new companies also take and create benefit and wellbeing  
No, bees don’t steal  
Bees only create benefit, making profit  
Let’s try to be inspired by nature
