It has been an amazing conference within the athmosphere of Paris.

EAEF invited my to give the Friday's keynote talking about Amour and management practices.

I see organisations as platform where people are developing or destroying themselves. But before talking about practices I want to focus on who is really crossing the door (physically or virtually) of the organisation.

A person shows herself with two main behavior:
- the deep side of here where there are her believes, way of living, etc.
- the ego where there is the predominant facet of a "wannabe" or what do the company wants from me. It's written in the hiring proposal, you will be there to be a [fill in the blanks].

A person come with her strong behaviors focused on EGO. Of this half personality the actual society hinders to show your feminine side. Every man as a feminine side and, every woman has a masculine side. The feminine side can be a sharing and caring approach where you act as the mother.
