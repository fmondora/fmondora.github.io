It has been an amazing conference within the athmosphere of Paris.

EAEF invited my to give the Friday's keynote talking about Amour and management practices.

I see organisations as platform where people are developing or destroying themselves. But before talking about practices I want to focus on who is really crossing the door (physically or virtually) of the organisation.

## 1/2 Ego centered approach Ego

A person shows herself with two main behavior:
- the deep side of here where there are her believes, way of living, etc.
- the ego where there is the predominant facet of a "wannabe" or what do the company wants from me. It's written in the hiring proposal, you will be there to be a [fill in the blanks].

## 1/4 Male oriented -- Egomale
A person come with her strong behaviors focused on EGO. Of this half personality the actual society hinders to show your feminine side. Every man as a feminine side and, every woman has a masculine side. The feminine side can be a sharing and caring approach where you act as the mother.

So, when a person is crossing the door, she's loosing also the female aspect of her ego. So she is crossing the door as a egocentered male, which represents one fourth of you.

## 1/16 Emotional, Spiritual, Intuitive and Rational side -- Egomational
And now the rest of the person (Egomale) on the latest one fourth is split into 4 parts:
- ***The emotional*** side which is forbidden to express in the company. Is she free to express how a contract is moving her? Can she say that if she signs that agreement it will make her crying. The answer is simply no to every emotional state. So emotions are fobidden
- ***Spiritual*** is when she wants to bring her religious consideration into account of a profession. She is not allowed to talk about religion and politics while working. Think, she cannot change the statements of an agreement - at least in the western cultures - with spiritual things. So spiritual is still forbidden.
- ***Intuition*** is when she wants to take decisions driven by the guts. We are in the era of analytics, so it is profane to start asking to guts. If Henry Fords looked at analytics the only things he was building was a fastest horse and not a car. Entrepeneurs are mostly driven by gut feelings and most of them are impeding intuition to their peers. Intuition is avoided in corps.
- ***Rational*** is when she is considering a much more logic approach to things. Everything must be a consequence. Every question must have a prompt answer. This is very accepted in all corporates.

So, the current culture is promoting a **Rational, Egocentric Male** culture; which is 1 sixteenth of the entire person that is walking the company door.

Oragnisation should work much on all these aspects which are Rationally losts. Happiness is a status which balances all these aspects of every person inside the company team.
