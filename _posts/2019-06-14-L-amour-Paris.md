It has been a fantastic conference in the atmosphere of Paris.

EAEF invited me to give Friday's keynote talking about Amour and management practices.

I see organizations as a platform where people are developing or destroying themselves. But before talking about practices, I want to focus on who is really crossing the door (physically or virtually) of the organization.

## 1/2 Ego-centered approach Ego

A person shows herself with two primary behavior:
- the low side of here where there are her believes, way of living, etc.
- The ego where there is the predominant facet of a "wannabe" or what do the company wants from me. It's written in the hiring proposal, you will be there to be a [fill in the blanks].

## 1/4 Male oriented -- Egomale
A person comes with her dynamic behaviors focused on EGO. Of this half personality, the actual society hinders to show your feminine side. Every man as a feminine side and, every woman has a masculine side. The female part can be a sharing and caring approach where you act as the mother.

So, when a person is crossing the door, she's also losing the female aspect of her ego. So she is passing the door as an ego-centered male, which represents one-fourth of you.

## 1/16 Emotional, Spiritual, Intuitive and Rational side -- Egomational
And now the rest of the person (Egomale) on the latest one fourth is split into 4 parts:
- ***The emotional*** side which is forbidden to express in the company. Is she free to show how a contract is moving her? Can she say that if she signs that agreement it will make her cry? The answer is simply no to every emotional state. So emotions are forbidden
- ***Spiritual*** is when she wants to bring her religious consideration into account of a profession. She is not allowed to talk about religion and politics while working. Think, she cannot change the statements of an agreement - at least in the western cultures - with spiritual things. So religious is still forbidden.
- ***Intuition*** is when she wants to make decisions driven by the guts. We are in the era of analytics, so it is profane to start asking for guts. If Henry Fords looked at analytics, the only things he was building was the fastest horse and not a car. Entrepreneurs are mostly driven by gut feelings, and most of them are impeding intuition to their peers. Intuition is avoided in corps.
- ***Rational*** is when she is considering a much more logical approach to things. Everything must be a consequence. Every question must have a prompt answer. This is very accepted in all corporates.

So, the current culture is promoting a **Rational, Egocentric Male** culture; which is 1 sixteenth of the entire person that is walking the company door.

An organization should work much on all these aspects, which are Rationally lost. Happiness is a status which balances all these aspects of every person inside the company team.
